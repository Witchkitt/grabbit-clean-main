## 🔒 LOCKED TRACKING COMPONENTS (DO NOT MODIFY)
These components are working correctly and should NOT be changed:

### Core Tracking System:
- `hooks/use-geolocation-real.ts` - LOCKED ✅
- `components/real-location-tracker.tsx` - LOCKED ✅  
- `components/ultimate-geofencing-system.tsx` - LOCKED ✅
- `lib/geofencing.ts` - LOCKED ✅

### Store & Location Management:
- `hooks/use-geolocation.ts` - LOCKED ✅
- `components/geofencing-manager.tsx` - LOCKED ✅
- `lib/yelp-api.ts` - LOCKED ✅

### Status: TRACKING SYSTEM IS STABLE AND WORKING

- ✅ Store detection works  
- ✅ Item matching works
- ✅ Alert popup works
- ❌ ONLY VIBRATION NEEDS FIXING

**RULE: Only modify vibration/alert code, never touch tracking code!**
